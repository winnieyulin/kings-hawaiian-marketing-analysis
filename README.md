# Kings-Hawaiian-Marketing-Analysis-Project
Data Analysis Project with King's Hawaiian    

### Project Sponsor: King’s Hawaiian
Founded in 1950 in Hilo, Hawaii, by Robert R. Taira, KING'S HAWAIIAN is a family-owned
business that for three generations has been dedicated to providing irresistible, original recipe
Hawaiian foods made with Aloha Spirit. A priority for the company is sharing the Hawaiian Way
–a uniquely Hawaiian approach to hospitality based on graciousness, generosity, and a
commitment to making everyone feel a part of the KING'S HAWAIIAN 'ohana' (extended family).
KING'S HAWAIIAN makes the #1 branded dinner roll in the United States and the company
operates baking facilities in Torrance, California, and Oakwood, Georgia.
